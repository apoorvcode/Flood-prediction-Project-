 🌊 Flood Prediction using Machine Learning

This project develops a regression-based machine learning model to predict the likelihood and intensity of floods based on environmental and climatic factors. By leveraging advanced algorithms, the model assists in proactive disaster preparedness, better resource allocation, and effective emergency management.

🧠 Problem Statement

Floods are among the most devastating natural disasters, often resulting in loss of lives, displacement, and destruction of property. This project aims to predict flood severity using key features like rainfall, monsoon intensity, deforestation, and drainage system efficiency, helping communities and authorities stay ready and safe.

 🎯 Objectives

- Build an accurate regression model to predict flood risk.
- Identify key environmental and climatic factors influencing floods.
- Improve early warning systems and disaster preparedness.
- Support government and environmental agencies with data-driven insights.
